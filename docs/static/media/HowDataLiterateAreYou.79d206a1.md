Data literacy is the ability to understand, manage and communicate data as meaningful information. This applies whether data is the primary focus of your work or one of many facets of your work as a member of the BC Public Service.

Widespread data literacy is critical to foster a culture of data use and support evidence-based decision making in our modern, digital context.
A data literate workforce is one that can use data to improve the quality of decisions and services; knows when and how to question the accuracy and validity of data; read, understand and use data ethically; explore data to generate new ideas and design innovative solutions; and represent information visually and communicate it to an audience.

This self-assessment is intended to help members of the BC Public Service assess their existing skillset, and to guide the development of learning pathways and resources that will provide foundational data literacy to all public service employees, as well as continuous development pathways for data-driven roles.

A data persona is a way of understanding organizational data activities, and also helps to chart an individualized learning path based on the knowledge and skills required to perform these activities. It is entirely possible to relate to more than one data persona. For example, a Business Translator may also perform the activities of a Data Governor, and a Data Governor may also be an Architect.
